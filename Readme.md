# Native GraphHopper App

Calculate offline routes and distances with GraphHopper on the Android
device using a native image of GraphHopper instead of the jar dependency.

It already works :) ! And performance is "okay". E.g. 300km route within 
2 seconds on a OnePlus 5T device.

There are the following advantages:

 * no per-process virtual memory limit (see current lower other memory problems)
 * GraphHopper itself does not need to limit itself to Java 7
 * this process here is the "Android Java" path but works also and much easier with Gluon and JavaFX
 * same process could work for iOS too
 * public transit could work too (currently requires Java 8 features)
 * data import of raw OSM files (especially for small areas) could work too (i.e. on-demand areas and routes could be possible)

The main disadvantage is the complexity of the process: you not only need to
build the graphhopper jar but the Android NDK & SDK and GraalVM and a maven
plugin to create a native library that apps integrate via Android NDK and
not 'directly'.

## Get Started

### Build the Graph Files

 * Get the repository https://github.com/karussell/graphhopper-native-image/
   and switch to branch clientplugin
 * mvn clean install
 * download a pbf file from OSM e.g. `wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/berlin-latest.osm.pbf`
 * `ln -s berlin-latest.osm.pbf osm.pbf`
 * `java -jar target/graphhoppernative-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
 * `adb push graph-cache/ /data/local/tmp/`

### Get the GraphHopper Native Library

Follow instructions in https://github.com/karussell/graphhopper-native-image/pull/2

Copy the created `libgraphhoppernative.so` into `distribution/ghlib/arm64-v8a/`
of this repository here.

## TODOs

 * Communication with library is unclear. Currently we can only send
   coordinates to it but cannot receive something (we can only read log messages)
 * What other targets besides arm64-v8a can we support?
 * Can we avoid app crashes when doing multiple route calculations (how is memory management done?)
 * There are app crashes when doing longer routes (memory problems)
